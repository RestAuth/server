RestAuth 0.6.0 (XX XX 20XX)

  General:
  * Greatly simplify default logging configuration
  * Migration to Django generic class-based views
  * Globally cache username validators and pasword hashers

  Compliance with RestAuth:
  * This release complies with RestAuth 0.6, adding support for setting
    multiple properties at once. Support for status code 403 was already added
    in the previous release.
  * All resource names (names of users, groups and properties) are now
    consistantly lower-cased.

  Database schema:
  * Many new indizes
  * Remove useless subclass-relation for services
  * Uniqueness for groups is now enforced on a schema-level

  Testing:
  * Most testcases no longer use transactions speeding up testruns a bit
  * Hashing tests for custom hashes also check shorter usernames

RestAuth 0.5.3 (11 August 2012)

  General:
  * Removed the migration directory, as the scripts there are now maintained in
    a dedicated git repository:
        https://git.fsinf.at/restauth/migration
  * Add a test fixture that can be used by the manage.py testserver. setup.py
    now includes a 'testserver' command that automatically loads that fixture.
    Libraries that require a testserver for testing should run 'setup.py
    testserver' instead of the now deprecated test.sh script.
  * The WSGI script now passes the RESTAUTH_HOST environment variable.
    doc/config/multiple-instances.rst suggests using this variable, but WSGI
    applications never receive this variable otherwise. Likewise, the
    DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE is passed through if set.
  * Generated passwords no longer contain whitespace, a backslash, single or
    double quotes.
  * Fix a bug that broke Service passwords with a colon (':')
  * Most of the code now adheres to python coding standards.
  * restauth-service now has set-hosts, add-hosts and rm-hosts, which is in line
    with the new permission system. The 'add' command can no longer add hosts in
    one step, since the command would be too overloaded.
  
  Django 1.4.0 compatibility fixes:
  * 'setup.py testserver' now works different for 1.4.0, because 'manage.py
    testserver' is broken in 1.4.0. See: 
        https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/18019
  
  Permissions:
  * RestAuth now offers a brand-new permission system. Services can only perform
    the operations they are explicitly configured for. This improves security,
    because leaked service credentials limit the potential damage an attacker
    can do.
  * The permissions are managed with restauth-service. The new commands are
    set-permissions, add-permissions and rm-permissions.
  * The available permissions are documented in the man-page for
    restauth-service and here:
        https://server.restauth.net/restauth-service.html
  
  build-related:
  * The 'debian' branch now includes a ready-to-use debian package. Several
    distro-specific branches include packages for older distributions.
  * The new command 'prepare_debian_changelog' updates debian/changelog to the
    newest version
  * scripts found in bin/ are now automatically installed.
  * manage.py gets an automatic symlink in $PREFIX/bin

  Passwords:
  * Support empty salts (some legacy systems to not use a salt)
  * You can now implement support for a custom hash and add it to RestAuth using
    the HASH_FUNCTIONS setting
  * Support two new algorithms:
    * 'crypt': Store passwords using the systems 'crypt' routine
    * 'apr1': Store passwords using the apache modified version of MD5
      commonly used in .htpasswd files
  * Added test-functions for custom hashing algorithms

  Validators:
  * Massively rewrote the validator system. It is now way faster and more
    powerul:
    * deprecated SKIP_VALIDATORS setting
    * introduced the new VALIDATORS setting (essentially the inverse to the
      former)
    * validators are now classes instead of functions
    * rewritten and optimized the validation function
  * new 'drupal' validator that actually uncovers a bug in Drupal (see
    documentation). This validator is much more restrictive than drupal at this
    moment.

  Groups:
  * Speed up group creation
  * some code-cleanup (remove one-line functions, etc.)
  * Improve speed of getting groups of a user

  Documentation:
  * Improved documentation in lots of places
  * Add upgrade notes
  * setup.py includes the new target build_html
  * Add minimal manpage for restauth-manage
  * Add developer/testserver documenting how to run a testserver for library
    testing
  * Add installation instructions for RHEL and Fedora
  * Add installation instructions for ArchLinux

RestAuth 0.5.2 (13 November 2011)

  * Add basic routers for common replication scenarios
  * Adapt to changes in RestAuthCommon (CONTENT_HANDLERS now is in
    RestAuthCommon.handlers)
  * No longer use deprecated functions in RestAuthCommon
  * Remove a lot of deprecated code, unused parameters, etc
  * Fix traceback when deleting hosts in services
  * Reserved usernames are no really blocked
  
  Documentation:
  * Add documentation on running multiple instances on the same host
  * Fix many spelling mistakes in the documentation
  
  Testing:
  * Add 'test' target to setup.py that runs all tests
  * Add 'coverage' target to setup.py that creates test-coverage in
    doc/coverage/
  * Many additional tests to improve test-coverage
  * Optimize Tests to use common methods

RestAuth 0.5.1 (10 September 2011)

  * Also install RestAuth.Test (this should have been installed).
  * Add this ChangeLog.

RestAuth 0.5.0 (29 August 2011)
