RestAuth 0.5.3 (XX XX 20XX)

  General:
  * There were some schema updates. Please read:
    	https://server.restauth.net/install/upgrade.html
  * Removed the migration directory, as the scripts there are now maintained in
    a dedicated git repository:
        https://git.fsinf.at/restauth/migration
  * Add a test fixture that can be used by the manage.py testserver. setup.py
    now includes a 'testserver' command that automatically loads that fixture.
    Libraries that require a testserver for testing should run
    'setup.py testserver' instead of the now deprecated test.sh script.
  * The WSGI script now passes the RESTAUTH_HOST environment variable.
    doc/config/multiple-instances.rst suggests using this variable, but WSGI applications never
    receive this variable otherwise. Likewise, the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE is passed through if set.

  Users:
  * Add database index for the username.

  Passwords:
  * Support empty salts (some legacy systems to not use a salt)
  * You can now implement support for a custom hash and add it to RestAuth using
    the HASH_FUNCTIONS setting
  * Support two new algorithms:
    * 'crypt': Store passwords using the systems 'crypt' routine
    * 'apr1': Store passwords using the apache modified version of MD5
      commonly used in .htpasswd files
  * Added test-functions for custom hashing algorithms

  Validators:
  * Massively rewrote the validator system. It is now way faster and more
    powerul:
    * deprecated SKIP_VALIDATORS setting
    * introduced the new VALIDATORS setting (essentially the inverse to the
      former)
    * validators are now classes instead of functions
    * rewritten and optimized the validation function
  * new 'drupal' validator that actually uncovers a bug in Drupal (see
    documentation). This validator is much more restrictive than drupal at this
    moment.

  Groups:
  * Speed up group creation
  * some code-cleanup (remove one-line functions, etc.)
  * Add database index for the groupname
  * Improve speed of getting groups of a user

  Documentation:
  * Improved documentation in lots of places
  * Add upgrade notes
  * setup.py includes the new target build_html
  * Add minimal manpage for restauth-manage
  * Add developer/testserver documenting how to run a testserver for library testing
  * Add installation instructions for RHEL and Fedora

RestAuth 0.5.2 (13 November 2011)

  * Add basic routers for common replication scenarios
  * Adapt to changes in RestAuthCommon (CONTENT_HANDLERS now is in
    RestAuthCommon.handlers)
  * No longer use deprecated functions in RestAuthCommon
  * Remove a lot of deprecated code, unused parameters, etc
  * Fix traceback when deleting hosts in services
  * Reserved usernames are no really blocked
  
  Documentation:
  * Add documentation on running multiple instances on the same host
  * Fix many spelling mistakes in the documentation
  
  Testing:
  * Add 'test' target to setup.py that runs all tests
  * Add 'coverage' target to setup.py that creates test-coverage in
    doc/coverage/
  * Many additional tests to improve test-coverage
  * Optimize Tests to use common methods

RestAuth 0.5.1 (10 September 2011)

  * Also install RestAuth.Test (this should have been installed).
  * Add this ChangeLog.

RestAuth 0.5.0 (29 August 2011)
