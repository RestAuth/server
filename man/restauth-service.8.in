.SH NAME
restauth-service \- Utility to manage services able to access RestAuth.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B restauth-service
[options] \fIaction\fR \fIargs\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
The purpose of \fBrestauth-service\fR is to manage services that use RestAuth.
The authentication credentials configured with this tool also have to be set in
the service using it.
.SH AUTHENTICATION DETAILS
Credentials are composed of a name, a password and one or more hosts from which
requests may come. The RestAuth service denies requests coming from an invalid
host, even if the credentials are correct.
.SH OPTIONS
.RS 4
.RE
__SETTINGS_OPTION__
\fB\-\-password\fR=\fIPWD\fR
.RS 4
Use \fIPWD\fR for the password for actions \fBadd\fR and \fBset-password\fR. If
you do not use this option for these actions, you will be prompted
interactively.
.SH ACTIONS
.sp
With each invocation of \fBrestauth-service\fR, you can give exactly one action.
.sp
\fBadd\fR \fIservice\fR [\fIhost\fR] ...
.RS 4
Add a \fIservice\fR to RestAuth. The \fIservice\fR can contain any ASCII
character except a double colon (':'). You can give one or more \fIhosts\fR that
the new \fIservice\fR is able to connect from. If ommitted, the \fIservice\fR
can't connect from any host and is thus unusable. 

If you don't specify the password with the \fB--password\fR option, you will be
prompted for it interactively.
