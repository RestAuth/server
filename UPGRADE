Please see the sphinx generated documentation for upgrade notes. You can
generate the most recent version of the upgrade notes if you run:

	python setup.py build_doc

and point your browser to doc/_build/html/index.html in your local filesystem
hierarchy. There also is an online version available here:

    https://server.restauth.net/install/update.html
