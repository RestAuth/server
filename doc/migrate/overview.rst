Overview of migration solutions
-------------------------------

This page collects scripts/plugins/etc. that can export data of an existing service into the
:doc:`import data format </migrate/import-format>`. This list is not intended to be complete, but if
you know of additional solutions, just :doc:`contact </contribute>` us and we will add it to the
list.

htpasswd files
==============

``htpasswd`` files are generated by the Apache webserver (most commonly the ``htpasswd`` command)
and are used for basic access authentication.

The script found in the ``htpasswd`` directory of the :ref:`migration_repository` converts such
files into the :doc:`import data format </migrate/import-format>`. It supports passwords encrypted
with the crypt, md5 and sha1 algorithms as well plain-text passwords.
