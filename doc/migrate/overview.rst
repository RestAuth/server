Overview of migration solutions
-------------------------------

This page collects scripts/plugins/etc. that can export data of an existing service into the
`import data format </migrate/import-format>`_. This list is not complete, but if you know of
additional solutions, just `contact </contribute>`_ us.

htpasswd files
==============

``htpasswd`` files are generated by the Apache webserver (most commonly the ``htpasswd`` command)
and are used for basic access authentication.

The script found in the ``htpasswd`` directory of the :ref:`migration_repository` converts such
files into the `import data format </migrate/import-format>`_. It supports passwords encrypted by the
crypt, md5 and sha1 algorithms as well plain-text passwords.

Linux systems
