How to contribute
=================

RestAuth is Free Software and as such invites everyone to contribute in any way possible.

* If you find bugs or want to request new features, you can simply
  `file a new issue <issue-tracker-new_>`_ in our `issue tracker
  <issue-tracker_>`_.
* You can also join our `XMPP/Jabber multi user chat <chat_>`_.
* Our codebase is hosted `on GitHub <git_>`_.  You can fork our codebase and code
  your own improvements and do a merge-request to get your changes into the
  "official" codebase.
