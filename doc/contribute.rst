How to contribute
=================

RestAuth is Free Software and as such invites everyone to contribute in any way possible. 

* If you find bugs or want to request new features, you can simply `file a new issue
  <https://redmine.fsinf.at/projects/restauth-server/issues/new>`_ in our `issue tracker
  <https://redmine.fsinf.at/projects/restauth-server>`_.
* You can also join our XMPP/Jabber multi user chat at ``rest@conference.jabber.at``. If you don't
  have an account, you can join it without an account `using speeqe
  <http://speeqe.com/room/rest@conference.jabber.at/>`_.
* Our codebase is hosted at https://git.fsinf.at/restauth/server. You can fork our codebase and
  code your own improvements and do a merge-request to get your changes into the "official"
  codebase.
  
  Note that git.fsinf.at already uses a RestAuth installation. Account registration is not possible
  on git.fsinf.at itself, please `register here <https://fsinf.at/user/register>`_.
