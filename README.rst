RestAuth
========

RestAuth_ is a project providing shared authentication, authorization and
preferences. Shared authentication and preferences allow users to use a single
account on multiple services (such as websites, mail, system accounts, ...),
sharing preferences among those systems. Shared authorization allows
administrators to manage permissions for users in a central and easy way.

This is a mirror of the server-side reference implementation of RestAuth, the
most up-to-date documentation can always be viewed at
https://server.restauth.net.
