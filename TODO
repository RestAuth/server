0.7.0:

* Consistently use assertRaises as context manager.
* Add our own in-memory cache in settings that we can use as secure cache.
* Remove SECURE_CACHE setting.
* backend.create_user still returns a user because of many tests still using it
  in later backend methods - should be removed.
* Same for backend.create_group.
* backend.get() should be removed
* Document DATA_BACKEND setting, update backend documentation.
* GroupNotFound/GroupExist should require two params: name and service.
* Make kwargs consinstent, e.g. group_exists gets "name", set_users_for_group gets "group"

Future:

* add support for /users/<user>/blobs
