0.7.0:

* Consistently use assertRaises as context manager.
* Add our own in-memory cache in settings that we can use as secure cache.
* Remove SECURE_CACHE setting.
* backend.create_user still returns a user because of many tests still using it
  in later backend methods - should be removed.
* Same for backend.create_group.
* backend.get() should be removed
* Document DATA_BACKEND setting, update backend documentation.

Future:

* add support for /users/<user>/blobs
